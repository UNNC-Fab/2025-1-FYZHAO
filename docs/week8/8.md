# Modeling and Casting
This week focused on learning the fundamentals of modeling and casting techniques, with an emphasis on hands-on experimentation using silicone rubber and AB epoxy resin.

## 1.Materials familerization - as group assignment
As part of the group assignment, we explored the properties and handling techniques of commonly used materials in casting and model-making. The focus was on HongYeJie Silicone HY-630 and AB epoxy resin, both of which were used in hands-on experiments.

### HongYeJie Silicone Rubber (HY-630)
· Type: Condensation-cure silicone rubber
· Form: Two-component system (Part A: Base Silicone, Part B: Curing Agent)
· Key Properties:
○ Medium hardness (Shore A ~30) with good flexibility
○ Excellent tear resistance and durability
○ High detail reproduction for mold applications
○ Suitable for both manual pouring and brush-on applications
· Applications:
○ Mold making for resin, plaster, cement, wax, and low-temperature alloy casting
○ Prototyping and artistic reproduction (e.g., figurines, decorative items)
· Mixing Ratio: 100:3 (by weight)
· Curing Time: 3–6 hours at room temperature (faster with heat)
· Special Notes:
○ Degassing is recommended for bubble-free molds
○ Compatible with a range of release agents for clean demolding

### AB Epoxy Resin
· Type: Two-part thermosetting epoxy system
· Form: Liquid before curing (Part A: Resin, Part B: Hardener)
· Key Properties:
○ High transparency (can be pigmented as needed)
○ Strong adhesion and surface finish
○ Low shrinkage and good dimensional stability
· Applications:
○ Small cast items such as keychains, charms, buttons, or enclosures
○ Decorative inlays and bonding layers
· Mixing Ratio: Typically 1:1 or 2:1 (by volume) depending on supplier
· Curing Time: 12–48 hours at room temperature (accelerated by gentle heating)

### Safety and Handling Guidelines
· Always wear gloves, safety goggles, and work in a well-ventilated area
· Carefully follow mixing ratios and stirring procedures to ensure consistent curing
· Store both silicone and resin components in sealed containers away from moisture and direct sunlight

This material study provided our group with a practical foundation for casting workflows and deepened our understanding of mold-making processes with professional-grade silicone and resin systems.

## 2.Creating a Duck-Shaped Charm Using Silicone Molding and AB Epoxy Resin

This process outlines the steps to duplicate a duck-shaped charm using silicone rubber mold making and transparent AB epoxy resin casting. The original duck charm is used as the master model.

### Materials & Tools
· Duck-shaped original charm (master model)
· HongYeJie Silicone HY-630 (or other mold-grade silicone)
· AB epoxy resin (transparent)
· Mixing cups and stir sticks
· Digital scale
· Gloves and protective equipment
· Plastic or acrylic container (for mold box)
· Release agent (optional but recommended)
· Hot glue gun or adhesive putty (to fix model in place)

### Part 1: Creating the Silicone Mold
#### Prepare the Mold Box
· Choose a plastic container slightly larger than the duck charm.

#### Mix Silicone (HY-630)
· Mix Part A and Part B of the silicone rubber in a 100:3 weight ratio.

· Stir thoroughly and slowly to minimize air bubbles.

· Optional: Vacuum degas to remove bubbles for high detail.

#### Pour Silicone Over Model
· Slowly pour silicone from one corner, allowing it to rise and cover the entire model.
· Tap the container gently to help bubbles rise.

· Let the silicone cure at room temperature for 4–6 hours, or as recommended.

#### Demold
· Once cured, remove the mold from the container.
· Carefully pull out the original duck charm. You now have a reusable silicone mold.
Unfortunately, our proportioning failed and the silicone couldn't solidify completely.

 ### Part 2: Casting the Transparent Duck with AB Epoxy Resin
#### Prepare the Epoxy Resin
· Mix Part A (resin) and Part B (hardener) according to the product’s specified ratio (commonly 1:1 or 2:1 by volume).
· Stir slowly and evenly to avoid bubbles.

Pour Resin into the Mold
· Carefully fill the duck-shaped silicone mold with the mixed epoxy.
