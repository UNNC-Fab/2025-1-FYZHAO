After studying relevant microcontroller and sensor technologies, we decided to utilize ​ultrasonic sensors , ​sodium ion sensors , ​WiFi modules , ​Raspberry Pi data processing modules , and an ​LCD screen to develop an ​in-vehicle autonomous driving assistant.

Key Components Explained:

+ ​Ultrasonic Sensors: Used for obstacle detection and distance measurement, leveraging their ability to emit and receive high-frequency sound waves.

+ ​Sodium Ion Sensors:  Ensuring real-time monitoring of driver health or environmental conditions.

+ ​WiFi Modules: Enable wireless communication and integration with cloud platforms for data transmission and remote control .
​Raspberry Pi: Acts as the central processing unit, supporting edge computing for tasks like sensor data fusion, AI inference, and system control .

+ ​LCD Screen: Likely an LCD display for user interaction, providing visual feedback on navigation, sensor status, or alerts.

This integration combines low-cost hardware (ultrasonic sensors, Raspberry Pi) with advanced sensing (sodium ion detection) and connectivity (dual-band WiFi) to create a robust, multifunctional autonomous driving assistant.

After finalizing the sensor selection, ​detailed sketches were created to facilitate ​subsequent 3D modeling and the ​3D printing of the enclosure.
